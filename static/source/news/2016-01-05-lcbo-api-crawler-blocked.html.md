**UPDATE: (Jan 6) The issue has been resolved and LCBO
API is functioning normally again. A big thanks to the LCBO team!

UPDATE: (Jan 6) It appears that the blockage was
[NOT intentional](https://twitter.com/LCBO/status/684740392529604609), and the
LCBO is working to resolve the issue.

On January 5th, 2016 the LCBO blocked LCBO API's crawler from accessing LCBO
websites. This means that LCBO API can not update its data.

It is still unknown whether this action was deliberate or an unintended
side-effect of something else.

What is known is that for the past 7 years LCBO API has been crawling LCBO.com
and serving a machine-readable version of it. I have attempted to get in touch
with LCBO management (unsuccessfully) and have yet to be contacted by the LCBO
in any way (ever). If this makes it to anyone at the LCBO, please
[contact me](mailto:heycarsten@gmail.com).

To the LCBO: I feel that blocking LCBO API is not a good idea, it's not good
for Ontarians and it's not good for the LCBO. It is used heavily and is a
source of goodwill and value for your corporation. I am open to any discussion
you wish to have and I am happy to work with you in any way. Frankly, I've
always wished you were fully involved!

For all of the creators of innovative applications that use LCBO API to
integrate LCBO store, product, and inventory data into their products; I am
sorry that this happened, hang in there though.
