Hey y&rsquo;all!

2018 has been a wild year. In March I was diagnosed with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma, an aggressive form of Non-Hodgekin Lymphoma. It was a shock. My treatment was progressing well until May when it stopped working. After a couple rounds of salvage chemotherapy I underwent an [Autologus Stem Cell Transplant](https://twitter.com/heycarsten/status/1024494222521638912)&ndash;*and so far it seems to be working!* I'm feeling better every day and I'm finally in a place where I can work again and mostly live my normal life.

During my treatment it became alarmingly clear to me that this project either needed to progress in a _**BIG**_ way or be retired. I have been in contact with the LCBO and they are not interested in supporting the project, they expect to have their own API released at some point soon though. I've put the feelers out to you, my users, and you've spoken too; LCBO API is just not something enough of you are willing/able to support financially.

LCBO API will continue to do its thing until **January 15th, 2019** at which point it will be shut down forever. I've met so many great people, I've been incredibly inspired, and I've learned a lot in the 10 years of running this project. I am forever grateful, thank you for being a part of it!
