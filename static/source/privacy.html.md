LCBO API collects and manages user data according to the following Privacy
Policy, with the goal of incorporating the values of transparency,
accessibility, sanity, and usability. This document is part of LCBO API's
[Terms of Service](/tos), and by using lcboapi.com (the “Website”), you agree to the

of Service in their entirety, and refer to those for definitions and contacts.

At LCBO API, we use the "Privacy by Design" approach. This means that we think
of privacy implication before building a new feature, we don't ask for
information we don't need, and we protect the information we have. We take
pride in treating our users' privacy the way we'd like to be treated by a
website like LCBO API, as individuals.
